The purpose of this package is to provide various extensions to the Plotly Dash framework. It can be divided into three main blocks, 

* The `snippets` module, which contains a collection of utility functions
* The `enrich` module, which contains various enriched versions of Dash components
* A number of custom components, e.g. the `Download` component

While the `snippets` module documentation will be limited to source code comments, the `enrich` module and the custom components are documented below.

## Enrichments

At the time of writing, the following enrichments (as compared to Dash 1.14.0) have been implemented,

* Ordering and form (single element versus list) of (`Output`, `Input`, `State`) does not matter. Hence, you could do this,

        @app.callback(Input("input_id", "input_prop"), Output("output_id", "output_prop"))

* A new `Trigger` component has been added. Like an `Input`, it can trigger callbacks, but its value is not passed on to the callback,

        @app.callback(Output("output_id", "output_prop"), Trigger("button", "n_clicks"))
        def func():  # note that "n_clicks" is not included as an argument 

* It is now possible to have callbacks without an `Output`,

        @app.callback(Trigger("button", "n_clicks"))  # note that the callback has no output

* A new `group` keyword makes it possible to bundle callbacks together. This feature serves as a work around for Dash not being able to target an output multiple times. Here is a small example,

        @app.callback(Output("log", "children"), Trigger("left", "n_clicks"), group="my_group") 
        def left():
            return "left"

        @app.callback(Output("log", "children"), Trigger("right", "n_clicks"), group="my_group") 
        def right():
            return "right"

* A new `ServersideOutput` component has been added. It works like a normal `Output`, but _keeps the data on the server_. By skipping the data transfer between server/client, the network overhead is reduced drastically, and the serialization to JSON can be avoided. Hence, you can now return complex objects, such as a pandas data frame, directly,

        @app.callback(ServersideOutput("store", "data"), Trigger("left", "n_clicks")) 
        def query():
            return pd.DataFrame(data=list(range(10)), columns=["value"])

        @app.callback(Output("log", "children"), Input("store", "data")) 
        def right(df):
            return df["value"].mean()

  The reduced network overhead along with the avoided serialization to/from JSON can yield significant performance improvements, in particular for large data. Note that content of a `ServersideOutput` cannot be accessed by clientside callbacks. 

* A new `memoize` keyword makes it possible to memoize the output of a callback. That is, the callback output is cached, and the cached result is returned when the same inputs occur again.

        @app.callback(ServersideOutput("store", "data"), Trigger("left", "n_clicks"), memoize=True) 
        def query():
            return pd.DataFrame(data=list(range(10)), columns=["value"])

    Used with a normal `Output`, this keyword is essentially equivalent to the `@flask_caching.memoize` decorator. For a `ServersideOutput`, the backend to do server side storage will also be used for memoization. Hence you avoid saving each object two times, which would happen if the `@flask_caching.memoize` decorator was used with a `ServersideOutput`.

To enable the enrichments, simply replace the imports of the `Dash` object and the (`Output`, `Input`, `State`) objects with their enriched counterparts,

    from dash_extensions.enrich import Dash, Output, Input, State

The syntax in the `enrich` module should be considered alpha stage. It might change without notice.

## Components

The components listed here can be used in the `layout` of your Dash app. 

### Download

The `Download` component provides an easy way to download data from a Dash application. Simply add the `Download` component to the app layout, and add a callback which targets its `data` property. Here is a small example,

    import dash
    import dash_html_components as html
    from dash.dependencies import Output, Input
    from dash_extensions import Download

    app = dash.Dash(prevent_initial_callbacks=True)
    app.layout = html.Div([html.Button("Download", id="btn"), Download(id="download")])

    @app.callback(Output("download", "data"), [Input("btn", "n_clicks")])
    def func(n_clicks):
        return dict(content="Hello world!", filename="hello.txt")

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run_server()

To ease downloading files, a `send_file` utility method is included,

    import dash
    import dash_html_components as html  
    from dash.dependencies import Output, Input
    from dash_extensions import Download
    from dash_extensions.snippets import send_file

    app = dash.Dash(prevent_initial_callbacks=True)
    app.layout = html.Div([html.Button("Download", id="btn"), Download(id="download")])

    @app.callback(Output("download", "data"), [Input("btn", "n_clicks")])
    def func(n_clicks):
        return send_file("/home/emher/Documents/Untitled.png")

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run_server()

To ease downloading data frames (which seems to be a common use case for Dash users), a `send_data_frame` utility method is also included,

    import dash
    import pandas as pd
    import dash_html_components as html

    from dash.dependencies import Output, Input
    from dash_extensions import Download
    from dash_extensions.snippets import send_data_frame

    # Example data.
    df = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2, 3, 4], 'b': [2, 1, 5, 6], 'c': ['x', 'x', 'y', 'y']})
    # Create app.
    app = dash.Dash(prevent_initial_callbacks=True)
    app.layout = html.Div([html.Button("Download", id="btn"), Download(id="download")])

    @app.callback(Output("download", "data"), [Input("btn", "n_clicks")])
    def func(n_nlicks):
        return send_data_frame(df.to_excel, "mydf.xls")

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run_server()


### Lottie

The `Lottie` component makes it possible to run Lottie animations in Dash. Here is a small example,

    import dash
    import dash_html_components as html
    import dash_extensions as de

    # Setup options.
    url = "https://assets9.lottiefiles.com/packages/lf20_YXD37q.json"
    options = dict(loop=True, autoplay=True, rendererSettings=dict(preserveAspectRatio='xMidYMid slice'))
    # Create example app.
    app = dash.Dash(__name__)
    app.layout = html.Div(de.Lottie(options=options, width="25%", height="25%", url=url))

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run_server()


### Keyboard

The `Keyboard` component makes it possible to capture keyboard events at the document level. Here is a small example,

    import dash
    import dash_html_components as html
    import json

    from dash.dependencies import Output, Input
    from dash_extensions import Keyboard

    app = dash.Dash()
    app.layout = html.Div([Keyboard(id="keyboard"), html.Div(id="output")])


    @app.callback(Output("output", "children"), [Input("keyboard", "keydown")])
    def keydown(event):
        return json.dumps(event)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run_server()
